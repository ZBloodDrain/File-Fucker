# File Fucker, fucks your files. Whaddya think?
Ok ok, that's not all. File fucker DOES fuck your files by attempting to fully wipe them from your drive to never be found, again.
All you really do is pick a folder (yes it must be a folder), and it WILL try to wipe all the subfolders and files in there. It will attempt to also wipe anything thats open, like a game file or app. Not that that shit works well, but whatever. It's there, and it's
useful.
